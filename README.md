### Current features:

<ul>
    <li> Physics based movement (Newtons equations)
    <li> Frame-rate independance
    <li> Camera implemented for x and y scrolling
    <li> Object oriented structure for building a bigger game
    <li> Passable collision detection, for slopes it may need some changes
</ul>

### Current bugs:

<ul>
    <li> moving the physical window will cause collision detection to fail, and you will fall to the bottom of the map.
</ul>
